                    <h6>2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope</h6>

                    <p>The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
                        this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
                        distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
                        Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
                        Contributor:</p>

                    <p>a. for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or</p>

                    <h6>2.4. Subsequent Licenses</h6>

                        License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if

                    <p>Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
                        Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to

                    <h6>2.6. Fair Use</h6>

                    <p>This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under

                    <h6>3. Responsibilities</h6>

                    <h6>3.1. Distribution of Source Form</h6>

                    <p>All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
                        Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
                        the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
                        Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
                        License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
                        attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
                        Form.</p>

                    <h6>3.2. Distribution of Executable Form</h6>

                    <p>If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:</p>

                    <p>a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,
                        as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the
                        Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by
                        reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost
                        of distribution to the recipient; and</p>

                    <p>b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
                        License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
                        license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the
                        recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.</p>

                    <h6>3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work</h6>

                    <p>You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
                        provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
                        the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
                        Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
                        Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
                        License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
                        under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
                        the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
                        Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
                        License(s).</p>

                    <h6>3.4. Notices</h6>

                    <p>You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
                        (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or
                        limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the
                        Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the
                        extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.</p>

                    <h6>3.5. Application of Additional Terms</h6>

                    <p>You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
                        indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
                        Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
                        behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
                        such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
                        You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
                        liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
                        indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
                        disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
                        jurisdiction.</p>

                    <h6>4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation</h6>

                    <p>If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
                        with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute,
                        judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of
                        this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the
                        limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a
                        text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under
                        this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation,
                        such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary
                        skill to be able to understand it.</p>

                    <h6>5. Termination</h6>

                    <p>5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You
                        fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,
                        then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor
                        are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor
                        explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing
                        basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by
                        some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into
                        compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are
                        reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the
                        non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have
                        received notice of non-compliance with this License from such
                        Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt
                        of the notice.</p>

                    <p>5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
                        infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,

                        directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
                        You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
                        2.1 of this License shall terminate.</p>

                    <p>5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user

                        validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to
                        termination shall survive termination.</p>

                    <h6>6. Disclaimer of Warranty</h6>

                    <p>Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is" basis,
                        without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory,
                        including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free
                        of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing.
                        The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software
                        is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect,
                        You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,
                        repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential
                        part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is authorized under
                        this License except under this disclaimer.</p>

                    <h6>7. Limitation of Liability</h6>

                    <p>Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
                        negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who
                        distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any
                        direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
                        character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of
                        goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
                        other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been
                        informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability
                        shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from
                        such party's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such
                        limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of
                        incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may
                        not apply to You.</p>

                    <h6>8. Litigation</h6>

                    <p>Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts
                        of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of
                        business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
                        jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing
                        in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring cross-claims or
                        counter-claims.</p>

                    <h6>9. Miscellaneous</h6>

                    <p>This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
                        matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
                        unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
                        necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that
                        the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not
                        be used to construe this License against a Contributor.</p>


                    <h6>10. Versions of the License</h6>

                    <h6>10.1. New Versions</h6>

                    <p>Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section

                        or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
                        steward.

                    <h6>10.3. Modified Versions</h6>

                    <p>If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
                        create a new license for such software, you may create and use a
                        modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove
                        any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that
                        such modified license differs from this License).</p>
